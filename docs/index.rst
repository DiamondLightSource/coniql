coniql
===========================

Write some introductory paragraphs here. They should describe:

- What the module does
- How it does it
- Why you should use it

If you have a diagram or screenshot, you can include it here.

Installation
------------

This section describes how to install the module so you can try it out.
For Python modules this often looks like this::

    pip install coniql

Usage
-----

Once you have installed the module your readers would like to know how
to get started with it. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

.. code:: python

    from coniql import HelloClass

    hello = HelloClass("me")
    print(hello.format_greeting())

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here::

    dls-python3-template-module person --times=2

The rest of the docs
--------------------

Everything else depends very much on your target module. The `API` section
should contain the reference material that a user of your module needs to use
your module. Consider adding tutorials to walk users through using your module,
how-to guides and FAQs to address particular problems, and explanations to say
why things should be done a particular way. More details in this article on
`writing good documentation`_
